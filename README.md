# XLOCK File Locker
A simple file locker I made with 2Toad's Rijndael256 encryption library, and DarkByte7's VisualPlus controls.
# How to use 

**Adding files:**
To add files, drag the file you want in XLOCK into the gray box labeled with 'Files', this is how you will interact with files in the 'XLOCKFiles' folder.

**Encrypting files:**
To encrypt a file, fill in a password of atleast 6 characters under the 'Encryption Password' field, click on the file, and hit encrypt.

**Decrypting files:**
To decrypt a file, click on the file, fill in the password you encrypted it with under the 'Encryption Password' field, and hit decrypt.

**Deleting files:**
To delete a file from XLOCK, select the file, and press the delete button. Always back your files up, kids.

**Opening files:**
To open files, select the file, and hit the 'Open Selected File' button.

# Using the shell
Start by typing in '-' into the command line located under the console, as the dash character is the prefix for the commands. A suggestion menu should pop up, use the arrow keys to navigate, and press enter to append the text to the command line.
