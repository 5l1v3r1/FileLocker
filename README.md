# XLOCK File Locker
A simple file locker I made with 2Toad's Rijndael256 encryption library, and DarkByte7's VisualPlus controls.
# How to use 
- Encrypting files:

To encrypt a file, drag the file you want to encrypt into the gray box labeled 'Files', then fill in a password of atleast 6 characters under the 'Encryption Password' field. Now click on the file that appeared in the gray box you dragged your file into and hit encrypt.
- Decrypting files:

To decrypt a file, click on the file, fill in the password you encrypted it with under the 'Encryption Password' field, and hit decrypt. 
- Deleting files:

To delete a file from XLOCK, select the file and press the delete button. Always back your files up, kids.
- Opening files:

Select the file, and hit the 'Open Selected File' button.

# Using the shell
Start by typing in '-' into the command line, as the dash character is the prefix for the commands. A suggestion menu should pop up, use the arrow keys to navigate, and press enter to append the text to the command line.
